# volterra-net
VolterraNet implementation and Spherical MNIST experiment. 


## Requirements

* Pytorch (0.4 <= )
* Tensorflow
* [s2cnn](https://github.com/jonas-koehler/s2cnn)

## Running Spherical MNIST

Please download the [MNIST dataset] (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and place it in a folder named "mnist_data" in the project directory.
Next, run the gendata.py script to generate the Spherical MNIST dataset. Now the seperate models can be trained by calling
